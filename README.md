# abra
This project builds Abra, an online bookstore, via Spring.
The idea was to build a RESTful API that allows authors to sell their books,
& customers to shop for what's available.

Several features are to be added to this project; the pending features include:
- a Genre entity to act as a tag for the listed books & author works
- a retrieval method taking customer & book IDs
- (most significantly) a Checkout system as a retailer is not a retailer at all w/o a means to submit transactions
  I have yet to decide if this application should use a native system for checkout or 3rd party tools.
